# Housing Prices Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using regression models based on various property features. By applying thorough data preprocessing, effective feature engineering, and training multiple regression algorithms, we achieved high prediction accuracy. We also implemented a vectorized linear regression model to visualize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and gain deeper insights into the optimization process.
